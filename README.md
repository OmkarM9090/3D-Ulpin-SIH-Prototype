# BHUMI 3D: 3D ULPIN Generation & Vertical Property Mapping System

An AI-assisted geospatial land administration platform designed to transition two-dimensional cadastral records into structured three-dimensional property models with vertical volumetric identity, underground utility mapping, and automated spatial topology validation.

Developed as a functional prototype for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Conventional cadastral frameworks in India and worldwide define land parcels strictly on a two-dimensional horizontal plane using surface coordinates (latitude and longitude). While the 2D Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (**ULPIN**) effectively indexes ground plots, rapid vertical urbanization creates multi-tiered property rights that existing cadastres cannot formally represent:

1. **Multi-Storey Vertical Ownership:** High-density residential towers and commercial complexes stack dozens of individual ownership units above a single parcel footprint. Standard 2D deeds cannot capture vertical boundaries ($Z$-axis), floor levels, or sub-parcel boundaries.
2. **Subterranean Infrastructure & Easements:** Basements, underground transit conduits, parking levels, and municipal utility corridors (water, electricity, gas, telecom, sewage) coexist below surface level without formalized 3D spatial boundaries, resulting in frequent infrastructure collisions during excavation and construction.
3. **Boundary Disputes & Encroachments:** Without 3D topological verification, cantilever balconies, underground extensions, and structural overlaps remain invisible on 2D land registry maps, creating legal ambiguities and tax assessment challenges.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

**BHUMI 3D** introduces a 3D cadastral digital twin pipeline that models surface footprints, vertical property units, and subterranean utility assets into an integrated, verifiable volumetric spatial registry:

```
[2D Cadastral Parcel] ➔ [3D Building Extrusion] ➔ [Floor & Unit Segmentation] ➔ [3D ULPIN Assignment] ➔ [Spatial Validation]
```

- **Volumetric Extrusion:** Ingests 2D parcel polygons and architectural parameters to generate georeferenced 3D volumetric building geometries.
- **Vertical Floor & Unit Slicing:** Discretizes multi-storey structures into individual spatial units (apartments, commercial suites, common facilities) with explicit elevation bounds ($Z_{\text{min}}$ to $Z_{\text{max}}$).
- **Proposed 3D ULPIN Extension:** Extends the standard 14-digit ULPIN into a hierarchical vertical property identifier incorporating State Code, District Code, Ground Parcel ID, Vertical Level/Floor, and Unit Hash.
- **Underground Utility Integration:** Visualizes and isolates subterranean utility corridors against parcel easements to ensure conflict-free infrastructure deployment.
- **Topological Conflict Engine:** Automatically validates 3D spatial geometry to detect volume intersections, cantilever encroachments, and boundary buffer violations.

## 4. Key Functional Modules

- **Interactive 3D GIS Workspace:** Rendered via WebGL using Three.js and React Three Fiber. Features coordinate display, cadastral gridlines, orbit/pan/zoom camera rigs, preset camera angles (Isometric, Top, Side, Street), and dynamic lighting.
- **Exploded Floor & Unit View:** Allows inspectors to expand multi-storey structures along the vertical axis for visual cross-sectional inspection and carpet area verification.
- **3D ULPIN Inspector:** Displays cryptographic and cadastral breakdowns of the 3D property identifier, including geographic hierarchy, vertical bounding coordinates, and verification confidence score.
- **Underground Infrastructure Visualizer:** Toggles subterranean layers with depth-stratified utility conduits, pipeline diameters, and depth clearances below the ground datum.
- **Spatial Validation & Remediation Modal:** Surfaces automated geometric rule checks (Volume Intersection, Cantilever Encroachment, Ground Coverage) with severity ratings and corrective actions.
- **Cadastral Activity & Metric Dashboard:** Real-time analytics summarizing total modelled units, underground assets mapped, geometry confidence scores, and historical spatial audit trails.
